## COM3D2.ChangeYotogiSpeed.Plugin
Thanks to the author of COM3D2.AddYotogiSliderSE.Plugin and COM3D2.AddYotogiSlider.Plugin.  
This is just a easy partial copy of COM3D2.AddYotogiSliderSE.Plugin.  

## How to use
Put dll into COM3D2\BepInEx\plugins\ (need BepInEx).  

#### Mode1 (constant mode)
In Yotogi scene, press "Space" to turn on or turn off the plugin.  
When turning on, press "<", ">" to adjust speed.  

#### Mode2 (dynamic mode)
In Yotogi scene, press "S" to turn on or turn off the plugin.  
When turning on, press "<", ">" to adjust speed change range (abs).  
" ↓ ", " ↑ " to adjust max speed up to, " ← ", " → " to adjust min speed down to.  
  
Either Mode turing on will turn off other Mode.  

## Version
0.0.1.0 is a stable version, which only contains Mode1.  
If you having issue with version 0.0.2.0, which I consider it is a beta version, please go back to 0.0.1.0.
